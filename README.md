## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I oulined the content with semantic tags in HTML. Then, I styled the website using CSS. I used flexbox for navigation bar and 2-3 columns sections. I used grid for the image gallery in the lookbook section. I used JavaScript to add event listener to the toggle button for mobile menu.

## Optimizations

I would like to integrate a booking system, e-commerce page and payment processor into the websites. I would also like to add testimonial section  with quotes from Ewatomi's current and past customers.

## Lessons Learned:

I experienced some difficulties when I was making the image gallery for the lookbook section. I learnt to ask for help when stuck. I wasn't familiar with grid so I asked for help on Discord. I also used resources on YouTube and Google to learn more about the grid system.
